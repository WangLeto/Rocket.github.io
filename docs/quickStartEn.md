# Quick Start

## Set Your Database And Start

Whatever, here are tips to get your Django connect with database.

- **venv ERROR**  
If within the venv you meet errors, just run shells inside the ```shell-py3``` folder or use ```python3 [commands]``` instead.
- **First, install the requirements** ( **PyMySQL** new added)
```bash
. ./init.sh
```
or run ```. ./shell-py3/init.sh```

- **Second, config your settings file.**  
Modify the password as yours in settings.py.  
However, I suggest just modify your database password as follow:
```sql
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('root');
```
The *password "root" is written in the settings.py* , no need to change it everytime.

- **Finally Create Database**  
Start your mysql or MariaDB, 
```sql
create database live default character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci; 
```

## Config the video server
 - find file ```easyrtc.js```and ```easyrtc_int.js```in ./node_moudles/easyrtc/api , then open them and search **serverPath** in them 
then replace 
```javascript
var serverPath = null
```
to
```javascript
var serverPath = 'http://localhost:8080;'
```
and
replace
```javascript
serverPath = socketUrl;
```
to
```javascript
serverPath  = 'http://localhost:8080;'
```
 **if you change the port in video server , you need to change the above code too**  

 After doing that above , you need to run the server before you visit the website
you need to run
```bash
node node_modules/easyrtc/server_example/server.js 
```
This command will open a server on port 8080

## another server
 - you only need another server to runï¼š
 ```bash
 node server/server.js
 ```
 this server is on port 3000
 
## open the webpage
 - Now, if everything well, you can visit this webpage:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
